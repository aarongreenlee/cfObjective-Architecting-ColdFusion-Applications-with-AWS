May 15-18, 2013 at cf.Objective Conference

Have you heard of the cloud? Yeah, it's different. No really. Join Aaron Greenlee as he shares experiences earned by him and the entire crew at WRECKINGBALL Media from their recent launch of the redesigned Adobe Education Exchange architected from the ground-up to run in the Amazon Cloud using services such as Elastic Beanstalk, SQS, RDS, ElastiCache, DynamoDB, SimpleDB and more--all integrated into the front-end, API and other backend systems.

- Review the problems the Education Exchange redesign faced including: real-time performance; gamification; improved observation of the application, etc...

- Walk through the design process of the API and sub-systems including async/sync calls.

- See how DynamoDB, SimpleDB, RDS, ElastiCache, SQS and ColdFusion all play togther to satisfty our design objectives.

- Gain first access to the shared library WRECKINGBALL is providing to integrate many services into CFML applications.

- Ask lots of questions.
